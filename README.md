# Data-Structure

This is a one of the courses that I am currently taking on educative.io platform called "Grokking Coding Interview Patterns in Python". I find this course well curated and structured and a good practice ground before you take a technical interview. I will be adding more and more questions and my solutions here. Some of the alternatives could be leetcode, neetcode, algoexpert, hackerrank.
